# My solution to the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata
This fork of [https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose) contains
my solution the Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata.

It was my approach:

1. Write unittests to cover the existing features, based on the specification.
2. Refactor to use the a variant of the [Chain of Responsibility pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern).
3. Add the new "Conjoured" requirement as a "chain".
